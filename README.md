A simple javascript project that generates a random anime quote which specify which anime it is from and which character in the anime said that quote.
The project is done with the help of animechan api.(https://animechan.vercel.app/api)


Here is the website:

Sometimes the Animechan website will be down.Thus it shows "Error occurred while fetching the quote"
